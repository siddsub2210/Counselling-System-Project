The zip file contains a folder 'ranklists' with both mains and advanced rank lists.
The excel workbook files are the original files, and the '_csvmsdos_text.txt' files are the text file copies in the csv format.
NOTE: the program only edits contents of the text files, and not the excel workbooks.

Admin_inputs file is also a text file with all the inputs including - IIT colleges' details and NIT colleges' details.
This file can be changed through an option in the program (option 1 of the menu driven program).

NONE OF THE ABOVE FILES NEED TO BE MODIFIED IN ANY WAY FOR THE PROGRAM TO FUNCTION.
HOWEVER, ALL THE NECESSARY FILE PATHS (only in main function) NEED TO BE CHANGED AS PER THE FILE DIRECTORY OF THE USER.

"code.txt" is the source code
